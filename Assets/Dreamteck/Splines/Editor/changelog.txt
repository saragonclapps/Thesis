----- 1.0.95 -----
FIX: Reduced garbage when Spline Users sample splines (thanks to community)
FIX: Reduced garbage inside the Spline.Evaluate method (thanks to community)
FIX: Fixed the NumberOverflow exception when entering a spline address where the spline is connected backwards
FIX: Fixed an editor freeze issue when splines are conncted backwards
FIX: Reduced the garbage caused by the SplineFollower.Move method
FIX: Fixed the projection method to work properly with spline addresses where splines are connected backwards
FIX: Spline Followers will not snap to the spline at start anymore if autoFollow is disabled

FEATURE: Added velocity modes for Spline Tracers (under Motion > Velocity Mode) which define how rigidbody velocities are handled when projecting and following along splines. 

----- 1.0.94 -----
FIX: The Spline Projector's triggers now work properly in Cached mode
FIX: SplineTracer Triggers no longer get called incorrectly when calling SetPercent and SetDistance
FIX: Improved the accuracy of direction calculation for end points of Bezier splines
FIX: The Object Controller no longer needs "Apply Rotation" to be on in order to randomize the position offset

FEATURE: Right-clicking the "Start Position" field of the Spline Follower will allow for entering a start distance instead of a percent
FEATURE: Offset, Scale and Rotation randomization now also works for Extruded channels in the SplineMesh component
FEATURE: The Object Spawn tool now retains the prefab links when spawning instances

API: Added an override for the Evaluate methods which takes a point index
API: Added the "GetPointPercent" method which converts a point index into a percent along the spline
API: Added the SplineMesh.Channel.offsetHandler callback for custom offset scripting
API: Added the SplineMesh.Channel.rotationHandler callback for custom rotation scripting
API: Added the SplineMesh.Channel.scaleHandler for custom scale scripting
API: The Object Spawn Tool in the editor no longer uses and relies on the Object Controller component and can work separately

----- 1.0.93 -----
FEATURE: Official 2018.2 support

----- 1.0.92 -----
FIX: Fixed the PathGenerator cutting down to half lenght when using double sided
FIX: Meshes without UVs no longer throw an exception in the SplineMesh component
FIX: Editor colors are now saved in a format, compatible with all regional settings

FEATURE: The Waveform Generator now rotates with the spline computer's transform.
FEATURE: The Particle Controller now applies spline colors to the particles
FEATURE: The Flat points operation now also flattens point normals
FEATURE: The Mirror points operation now also mirrors point normals

----- 1.0.91 -----
FEATURE: It is now possible to Shift-select spline points
FEATURE: Added a "loop samples" toggle for all SplineUsers to manually enable sample looping for closed splines

API: Added a CloneMesh method to all MeshGenerators useful when instantiating mesh generators from ones that exist in the scene

FIX: Fixed the ArgumentOutOfRange exception when extruding surfaces (bug introduced in 1.0.9)
FIX: Fixed the point deselection issue when control is pressed and a point that is already selected is clicked
FIX: Setting the SplineFollower's speed to 0 no longer triggers all triggers along the spline
FIX: The color property of the TubeGenerator now properly affects the round caps
FIX: Newly created mesh generators have the Default-Diffuse material assigned
FIX: Performing Undo on spline points connected to a Node now properly updates the Node

----- 1.0.9 -----
FEATURE: Introduced the SplineMesh component. This component aims to replace the now outdated ExtrudeMesh component and provides full control over the mesh generation.
FEATURE: Added the SmoothFree Bezier point type which allows for different tangent lengths while preserving the smoothness
FEATURE: The ObjectBender component is out of BETA
FEATURE: Added a SplineComputerTravel action
FEATURE: Added a SplineUserTravel action
FEATURE: Added a SplineTracerSetDistance action
FEATURE: Added an option to preserve the clip range behavior when using Uniform samples

FIX: The Round cap of the TubeGenerator no longer has black vertex colors
FIX: The Clip Range of the ObjectBender component now works properly
FIX: Drag-selecting points in the scene view no longer selects points behind the camera
FIX: Secondary mesh UVs are now preserved when bending and extruding meshes
FIX: Removed duplicate method calls for all Mesh generators - performance increased
FIX: Greatly reduced GC for all mesh generators
FIX: ParticleController - new particles no longer flicker for a single frame at the origin
FIX: ParticleController - old particles no longer change positions suddenly when new particles are born
